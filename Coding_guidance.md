### Detailed Protocol and Design for MRC File Conversion Toolkit

#### 1. **Overview**

The MRC File Conversion Toolkit is designed to provide a comprehensive set of tools for working with MRC (Medical Research Council) image files. The protocol and design outline below detail the architecture, modules, interfaces, error handling, testing, and user interaction for the toolkit.

#### 2. **Architecture**

- The toolkit will be implemented as a Rust library, consisting of multiple modules for different functionalities.
- Each module will encapsulate related operations and provide a clear interface for interaction.
- The modules will communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces, promoting modularity and extensibility.

#### 3. **Module Structure**

a. **Header Module** - **Purpose:** Parse MRC file headers and extract metadata. - **Functions:** - `parse_mrc_header(file_path: &str) -> Result<MrcHeader, MrcError>`: Parses the header of an MRC file and returns metadata as a structured MrcHeader object. - **Structs:** - `MrcHeader`: Represents metadata extracted from the MRC file header.

b. **Image Processing Module** - **Purpose:** Handle image processing tasks such as contrast adjustment, filtering, and histogram equalization. - **Functions:** - `adjust_contrast(image: &Image, options: &ContrastOptions) -> Image`: Adjusts the contrast of an image based on user-defined options. - `apply_filter(image: &Image, filter_type: FilterType) -> Image`: Applies a specified filter to the image. - **Enums:** - `FilterType`: Represents different types of image filters (e.g., Gaussian, Sobel, Median).

c. **Conversion Module** - **Purpose:** Facilitate conversion between MRC and other image formats. - **Functions:** - `convert_to_other_format(image: &Image, format: ImageFormat) -> Result<Image, ConversionError>`: Converts an image to the specified format. - `convert_from_tiff(file_path: &str) -> Result<Image, ConversionError>`: Converts an image from TIFF format to MRC format. - **Enums:** - `ImageFormat`: Represents supported image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG).

d. **Visualization Module** - **Purpose:** Provide tools for interactive visualization and exploration of MRC images. - **Functions:** - `display_image(image: &Image)`: Displays an image using a GUI or CLI interface with interactive features. - `zoom_in(image: &Image)`: Zooms in on a specific region of the image. - **User Interface:** - The visualization module may implement either a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) depending on user requirements.

e. **Quantitative Analysis Module** - **Purpose:** Implement algorithms for quantitative analysis, feature extraction, and statistical analysis of MRC image data. - **Functions:** - `measure_features(image: &Image) -> FeatureMeasurements`: Measures features of interest in the image and returns the measurements as a structured object. - `calculate_statistics(image: &Image) -> ImageStatistics`: Calculates statistical properties of the image data (e.g., mean, variance, skewness).

f. **Utility Module** - **Purpose:** Contains utility functions and helper methods used across different modules. - **Functions:** - `load_image(file_path: &str) -> Result<Image, ImageError>`: Loads an image from the specified file path. - `save_image(image: &Image, file_path: &str) -> Result<(), ImageError>`: Saves an image to the specified file path.

#### 4. **Interfaces and Error Handling**

- Each module will define clear interfaces (functions, structs, enums) for interacting with its functionality.
- Error handling will be implemented using Rust's Result and Option types, with custom error types for specific error scenarios.
- Error messages will be meaningful and descriptive to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.

#### 5. **Testing**

- Comprehensive unit tests will be written for each module to validate individual components and ensure correctness.
- Integration tests will be conducted to verify the interaction and interoperability of different modules.
- Mocking and stubbing techniques may be employed to isolate modules and simulate different scenarios for testing.

#### 6. **User Interaction**

- The toolkit may provide both command-line and graphical user interfaces for interacting with its functionalities.
- Command-line interface (CLI) commands will be designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and consistent with Rust's ergonomic principles.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) elements will facilitate interactive visualization and exploration of MRC images, providing tools for zooming, panning, and region-of-interest selection.

#### 7. **Dependency Management**

- Dependencies will be managed using Cargo, Rust's package manager, to handle library dependencies, versioning, and dependency
