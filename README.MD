### MRC File Conversion Toolkit: Documentation and Roadmap

#### Introduction
The MRC File Conversion Toolkit offers a comprehensive set of tools for working with MRC (Medical Research Council) image files. This document presents an overview of the toolkit's capabilities, including reading MRC file headers, interactive visualization, image conversion, quantitative analysis, and more. Additionally, it outlines a roadmap for future enhancements and developments to further enrich the toolkit's functionality.

#### Functionality Overview

1. **Read MRC File Header**
   - **Purpose:** Retrieve header information from MRC files.
   - **Implementation:** Utilizes the `read_mrc_header` function to parse the header information from an MRC file and return a structured representation of the header data.
   - **Usage:** Developers can call this function to extract metadata such as dimensions, data type, and other relevant information from MRC files.

2. **Display Image with Correct Contrast**
   - **Purpose:** Present MRC images with optimal brightness and contrast settings.
   - **Implementation:** Utilizes the `display_image_with_contrast` function to adjust the contrast of an image based on user-defined parameters.
   - **Usage:** Developers can integrate this functionality into visualization tools to enhance image clarity and improve interpretability.

3. **Convert MRC to Other Image Formats**
   - **Purpose:** Enable conversion of MRC files to popular image formats like PNG, JPEG, etc.
   - **Implementation:** The `convert_mrc_to_other_format` function facilitates the conversion process, allowing users to specify the output format.
   - **Usage:** This feature provides flexibility for sharing MRC data across different platforms and applications that support standard image formats.

4. **Convert to/from TIFF**
   - **Purpose:** Support conversion between MRC and TIFF image formats.
   - **Implementation:** The `convert_to_from_tiff` function enables bidirectional conversion between MRC and TIFF files.
   - **Usage:** Users can leverage this functionality to seamlessly exchange data between MRC-compatible software and systems utilizing TIFF format.

5. **Output MRC Stack as Single Image**
   - **Purpose:** Consolidate a stack of MRC images into a single composite image.
   - **Implementation:** The `output_mrc_stack_as_single_image` function merges multiple MRC images into a single image, preserving their relative positions.
   - **Usage:** Ideal for generating overview images or summaries from large datasets comprised of multiple MRC files.

6. **Add Images to MRC Stack**
   - **Purpose:** Expand existing MRC stacks by appending additional images.
   - **Implementation:** The `add_images_to_mrc_stack` function allows users to augment MRC stacks with new images, maintaining the integrity of the stack structure.
   - **Usage:** Useful for incrementally building datasets or incorporating new acquisitions into existing image collections.
